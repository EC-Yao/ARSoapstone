Mobile Augmented Reality App - ft. Cloud sharing

This app uses Google's ARCore development kit to implement augmented reality on supported smartphone devices. User's will
be able to scan local environments, create 3D objects in AR, and host these objects to the Cloud. Other users will then be able to
view these objects while in the same local environment as the original creator.

Development is currently in progress.
